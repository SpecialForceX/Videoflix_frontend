    <h2 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h2>
    <p><strong>Legal bases under the GDPR:</strong> Below is an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we
        process personal data. Please note that national data protection regulations may apply in addition to the
        provisions of the GDPR in your or our country of residence. If more specific legal bases are applicable in
        individual cases, we will inform you in the privacy policy.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR):</strong> Processing is necessary for the purposes of the
            legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party, except where such interests are overridden
            by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>National data protection laws in Germany:</strong> In addition to the GDPR, national data protection
        provisions apply in Germany, particularly the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz – BDSG),
        which contains specific regulations, e.g., on the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to object,
        and the processing of special categories of personal data.</p>

    <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with legal requirements, considering
        the state of the art, implementation costs, the nature, scope, and purposes of processing, as well as the
        varying likelihood and severity of risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.</p>
    <p>These measures include securing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical
        and electronic access to the data, as well as the access, input, transfer, availability, and separation of the
        data. We have also implemented procedures to ensure the exercise of data subject rights, deletion of data, and
        responses to data threats. Furthermore, we take data protection into account during the development or selection
        of hardware, software, and procedures, in accordance with the principle of data protection through technology
        design and privacy-friendly default settings.</p>
    <p><strong>Securing online connections through TLS/SSL encryption (HTTPS):</strong> We use TLS/SSL encryption to
        protect user data transmitted via our online services from unauthorized access. These technologies ensure that
        all data transfers meet the highest security standards, indicated by the presence of "HTTPS" in the URL.</p>

    <h2 id="m12">General Information on Storage and Deletion</h2>
    <p>We delete personal data in accordance with legal requirements as soon as the consent on which the processing was
        based is withdrawn or other legal bases no longer apply. This includes cases where the original purpose for
        processing no longer exists or the data is no longer required.</p>
    <p>Exceptions include legal obligations or legitimate interests that require longer storage or archiving.</p>
    <p>Data subject to commercial or tax retention obligations, or required for legal claims or the protection of
        rights, will be archived accordingly.</p>
    <p><strong>Retention periods under German law include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>10 years:</strong> e.g., annual financial statements, inventories, management reports (§ 147 AO, §
            257 HGB).</li>
        <li><strong>8 years:</strong> e.g., invoices and cost receipts.</li>
        <li><strong>6 years:</strong> e.g., business letters and other documents relevant for taxation.</li>
        <li><strong>3 years:</strong> e.g., data required for warranty or damage claims based on standard limitation
            periods (§§ 195, 199 BGB).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="m10">Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
    <p>Under the GDPR, you have the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to object:</strong> You may object at any time to the processing of your personal data for
            reasons arising from your particular situation.</li>
